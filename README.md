# voice-cloning
Voice cloning is the process of creating a synthetic voice using the audio recordings of a real person. Voice cloning uses Artificial Intelligence techniques to train a Machine Learning voice model on the real recordings to extract spectrums of the voice and create a voice that sounds almost exactly like the real voice.
